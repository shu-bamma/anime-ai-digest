Show the most recent digest output.

1. List files in `outputs/` sorted by date
2. Read the latest `.md` file and summarize: how many items per category, which sources are represented, the date range covered
3. If $ARGUMENTS is a date (e.g., `2026-02-26`), read that specific date's digest instead

Report any issues: empty categories, missing sources, broken formatting.
